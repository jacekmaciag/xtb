# XTB API client for Ruby

Xtb is a Ruby implementation of the [XTB broker API (xAPI) version 2.5.0](http://developers.xstore.pro/documentation/2.5.0).
At the time of writing this it's the latest version of the API.
This gem allows you to connect to the XTB broker and execute trades, get account information, and more.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add xtb

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install xtb

## Usage

### Configuration

Before you can connect to the XTB API, you need to configure the connection.
    
```shell
XTB__USER_ID=your_user_id
XTB__PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Connect to the XTB API

```ruby
require 'xtb'

# You're ready to use the API
Xtb::Http::CurrentUserData.call
```
Note that there is no need to log in first or log out afterwards. The gem handles the connection for you.

### Subscribing to the XTB API streaming commands

ðŸš§ The streaming API is not yet supported.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
